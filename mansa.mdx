description: "Run one command to install and set up any API."
---

Mansa allows developers to automatically install and setup an API in their repository by running **one** command.

## How it works

### 1. Run the command

```bash
npx mansa install trigger.dev
```

Running this command will first gather metadata about the current repository such as:

      - The language the repository is written in i.e `ts`, `js`
      - The runtime used in the repository. i.e `node`, `bun`, `deno`
      - The frameworks used e.g `next.js`, `react`, `angular`, `remix` and others...
      - The repository's primary package manager i.e `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm` or `bun`
      - The libraries used to handle major moving parts of the codebase e.g `prisma`, `trpc`, `firebase` ...

Based on this metadata, mansa will then retrieve the relevant information from the documentation and use this information to build an interactive command line tool to complete the current task.

### 2. Interactive walkthrough

Once the command line tool is ready, it will guide the user through each step of setting up trigger.dev in their repository while performing the steps on their behalf.
Mansa can perform the following actions on behalf of the user:

- Create new files
- Edit existing files
- Run commands

<Note>
  The user will always be prompted for confirmation before any of these actions
  are executed.
</Note>

Since the steps of the walkthrough are determined by the API documentation **and** the setup of the current repository,
the exact steps of the walkthrough and their order will vary. Here's an example:

- This is the first step when you run the command in a `next.js` repository using `yarn`:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/install-nextjs-yarn.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

- This is the first step when you run the command in a `sveltekit` repository using `pnpm`.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/install-svelte-pnpm.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

- If mansa couldn't find information on the package manager to use in a `next.js` repository, this might be the first step instead.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/install-select-package-manager.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>
