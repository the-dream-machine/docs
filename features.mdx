## Frictionless API setup

Mansa can **create** and **edit** files as well as **run commands** on behalf of the developer.
It can also **search** the whole repository to find relevant files and it can **read** files to make more informed edit suggestions.

Developers can sit back and review, modify and approve each step instead of switching between the documentation, their terminal and their IDE.

## Easy for developers to adopt

The command `mansa install ...` is a drop-in replacement for `npm install ...`.
It fits into the current development workflow without requiring any behavior change. There are **zero** switching costs.
There is no extension to install and no sign-up forms to fill. It's the fastest way to install and fully set up an API in any repository.

## Syntax highlighted previews

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/features-syntax-highlighting.png"
    alt="Hero Dark"
  />
</Frame>

For each step where the developer needs to `create` or `edit` a file, they will see a preview of the file with highlighted diffs.

This allows the developer to review the code without leaving the walkthrough. If things look good, the developer can press `enter` to apply the changes and continue with the walkthrough.
No more copy-pasting code.

## Logs visibility

</Frame>

Mansa can run the necessary terminal commands as part of the walkthrough. It will display the logs and even prompt the developer to retry failed runs.

For long-running commands, mansa will copy the command to the clipboard so the developer can paste it in a new terminal tab/window.

## Flexible configuration

Sometimes, developers may want to tweak a few things along the way. If that's the case, they can hit `tab` to bring up a chat box and request changes before they move on to the next step.
