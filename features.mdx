## Interactive walkthrough

Although mansa focuses on automating the tedious and boring parts of integrating an API, it is still important for the developer to understand how the API works.
This is why mansa doesn't run through the integration process in the background while the developer watches a loading spinner.

Instead, mansa acts as a guide that explains the purpose of each step making sure the developer understands how all the pieces fit together.

## Agent

Mansa can **create** and **edit** files as well as **run commands** on behalf of the user.
It can also **search** the whole repository to find relevant files and it can **read** files to make more informed edit suggestions.
When there are multiple available options to complete a task, mansa will prompt the user to select their preferred option instead of guessing and going down the wrong path.

## Syntax highlighted previews

<Frame>
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/features-syntax-highlighting.png"
    alt="Hero Dark"
  />
</Frame>

For each step where the developer needs to `create` or `edit` a file, they will see a preview of the file with highlighted diffs.

This means that the developer can review the code without leaving the walkthrough. When satisfied, the developer can press `enter` to apply the changes and continue with the walkthrough.
No more copy-pasting code.

## Run commands

  <img src="/images/run-commands.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Mansa can run the necessary terminal commands as part of the walkthrough. It will display the logs and even prompt the developer to retry failed runs.

For commands that are long-running, mansa will copy the command to the clipboard so the developer can run it in a new terminal tab/window.

## Works with any JS framework

Mansa works with all the JS frameworks that are supported by your API.

## Configure on the fly

Sometimes mansa might not get things right, if that happens, you can hit **tab** to request changes and nudge it in the right direction.

## We'll handle your setup and maintenance

Setting up mansa doesn't require any time or effort from your team, we take care of the onboarding, testing and maintenance.
We also regularly update the installer as you update your API.

We like to work fast and we typically complete the setup in less than **48hrs.**
You'll receive a message from us once your install command is live!
